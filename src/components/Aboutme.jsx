          <p>
            I'm a frontend developer passionate about building seamless and visually engaging digital products using modern technologies like React. I care deeply about user experience, design consistency, and clean, performant code.
          </p>
          <p>
            My journey into tech has been driven by curiosity and a desire to create. I've spent time learning the fundamentals and continue to explore new tools and best practices as I grow. I focus on translating ideas into responsive, intuitive web interfaces.
          </p>
          <p>
            I enjoy working on meaningful projects that make an impact â€” from idea to execution. Whether I'm designing UI layouts, connecting APIs, or improving performance, I thrive on solving problems and delivering value through code.
          </p>
          <p>
            When I'm not coding, I enjoy exploring design trends, learning from other developers online, and sharpening my skills with personal projects.
